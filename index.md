ICS 491 (002) is a special topics course that will focus on the [Hawaii Annual Code Challenge](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/). Professor Philip Johnson is running this course. 

To be qualified to take this course, you should have software design and implementation skills appropriate for HACC.  That typically means you have completed ICS 314 or have equivalent web application development experience.  If you are not sure whether you have the background appropriate to succeed in HACC, please send me an email. 

The course will work like this:

1. Register for ICS 491(002) for Fall 2017.  If you need an override, you can request one from Gerald or Philip Johnson.

2. Monitor the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge site. The date of the kickoff meeting for Fall 2017 has not been announced, but I have heard that it will be in late August.  If you're worried, send me an email in early August and I'll give you an update.

3. Attend the kick-off meeting. I will be taking attendance!

4. Form or join a team.  You can join up with fellow students in ICS 491 or with others. It doesn't matter.

5. Spend the first month of the semester working hard on HACC. Try to win! 

6. Regardless of whether you won or not, starting in October, you will continue to work on your HACC submission to make it even better. We will have a review at the end of October and at the end of November. 

7. Your final grade for the course will be based upon the system you developed for HACC and how much refinement you were able to make during the remainder of the semester.

There are no fixed meeting times for this course.   If you are working with a team in which you are the only ICS 491 member, and the team breaks up at the end of HACC, then you can continue to work on the project by yourself for the remainder of the semester.
